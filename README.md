# Shopping-List-App

## Introduction
This application is designed to allow users to add ingredients to a shopping list based on existing, or newly added, recipes found in the Cook Book secion of the application. 

## Description
One of the worst things when meal prepping, is getting home from your grocery run, firing up the stove, throwing some stuff on the fire and THEN realizing that you forgot to pick up a few key ingredients at the grocery store, because you never added them to the list. This appilcation is designed to guess work building a shopping list by buidling it for you.


When meal prepping, one of the most important tasks we must do is build a shopping list. This will take the guess work out of figuring out what ingredients need to be added to our shopping list. 

This application has two sections. 
1. Our list of recipes, which will display preset meals. It will also have a section that will will allow users to add new meals and ingredients to the server for later access. Each meal will also have the option to be delete that meal and the ingredients from the server. They will also have an "Add to Shopping List" button that will add all ingredients associated with this meal to the shopping list section.
2. Our list of ingredients, which will display all the items necessary for purchase. Each item will have a delete button to remove unnecessary items from the list. The list itself will also have a "Add Item" button that can be used to add miscellaneous items to pick up while shopping. It will also have a "Clear All" button to delete all the items from the shopping list so you can start with a clean slate.
