# Shopping-List-App

## Introduction
This application is designed to allow users to add ingredients to a shopping list based on existing, or newly added, recipes found in the Cook Book secion of the application. 

## Description
One of the worst things when meal prepping, is getting home from your grocery run, firing up the stove, throwing some stuff on the fire and THEN realizing that you forgot to pick up a few key ingredients at the grocery store, because you never added them to the list. This appilcation is designed to guess work building a shopping list by buidling it for you.

### Cook Book
The Cook Book stores meals and ingredients in one convenient place to be accessed at any time. Each meal comes with the option to add the ingredients from that meal to the shopping list. They all come with the option to delete that meal from the Cook Book as well. 
There is also a section to add new meals to the cookbook. You simply need to input the name of the meal as many or as few ingredients as you'd like. This meal will be added to the Cook Book and the ingredients can then be added to the shopping list.

### Shopping List
The shopping list contains all the ingredients that have been added from the meals in the Cook Book. Each meal has the option to be deleted when its either been picked up form the store, or you decide that you no longer need it. Maybe you accidently added two of the same time, or you found some leftovers in the back of the pantry. The Shopping List also has the option add miscellenous items to your list. That way, if you decide that you want to mix it up and add cheese to your risotto this week, you can simply add it to the list.
